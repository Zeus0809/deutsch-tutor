## New Feature Proposal

The idea here is simple: add ability for the user to hear the correct German pronunciation of words/phrases on screen as they are using the app.

It doesn't make much sense to have this ability in the main chat area, so the feature should be added to all three of the utility areas - the dictionary, verb conjugation, and noun gender & plural.

### UI/UX Goal
A small button with a sound icon that plays the word pronunciation when clicked.

### Backend
Probably need a TTS model. Explore implementation options using the google-genai SDK and pick one that makes the most sense.
